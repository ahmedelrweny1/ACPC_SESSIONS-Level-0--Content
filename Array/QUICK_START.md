## 💡 Teaching Tips

### For Live Sessions:
1. **Project on screen** and walk through each section
2. **Ask students** to predict outputs before showing
3. **Show edge cases** - what happens with index out of bounds?
4. **Live experiment** - let students suggest inputs

### For Self-Study:
1. **Progress sequentially** - don't skip sections
2. **Experiment freely** - try breaking things!
3. **Read the code** - study the C++ examples
4. **Try variations** - modify values and observe results

### For Homework:
1. Assign specific sections to complete
2. Ask students to screenshot their results
3. Give challenges: "Find sum of your own array"
4. Create custom problems based on the demos

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Page doesn't load?
- Make sure all files are in the Array folder
- Try a different browser
- Check browser console (F12) for errors

### Interactive demos not working?
- Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
- Clear browser cache
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled

### Visual issues?
- Zoom to 100% (Ctrl+0)
- Try fullscreen mode (F11)
- Use latest browser version

### Navigation problems?
